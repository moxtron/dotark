# dotark
This is a dotfile organizer similar to stow.
It takes dotfiles, puts them in a seperate folder and creates a symlink in the original path.
Also, it renames them, prepending the filename with "dot-" instead of ".".
It has only very basic functionality as of now. There might be more add-ons in the future
